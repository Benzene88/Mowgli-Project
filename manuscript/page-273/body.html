<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This is the great deep-sea song that all the St. Paul seals sing when they are heading back to their beaches in the summer. It is a sort of very sad seal National Anthem.</p><p>I met my mates in the morning (and, oh, but I am old!) Where roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled; I heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakers’ song— The Beaches of Lukannon—two million voices strong. </p><p> The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons, The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes, The song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame— The Beaches of Lukannon—before the sealers came! I met my mates in the morning (I’ll never meet them more!); They came and went in legions that darkened all the shore. </p></div> </div>
