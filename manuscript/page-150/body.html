What says the Law of the Jungle, Baloo?”</p><p>Baloo did not wish to bring Mowgli into any more trouble, but he could not tamper with the Law, so he mumbled: “Sorrow never stays punishment. But remember, Bagheera, he is very little.”</p><p>“I will remember. But he has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now. Mowgli, hast thou anything to say?”</p><p>“Nothing. I did wrong. Baloo and thou are wounded. It is just.”</p><p>Bagheera gave him half a dozen love-taps from a panther’s point of view (they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs), but for a seven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could wish to avoid. When it was all over Mowgli sneezed, and picked himself up without a word.</p></div> </div>
