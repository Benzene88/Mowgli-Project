And just because he knew that Nagaina’s children were born in eggs like his own, he didn’t think at first that it was fair to kill them. </p><p> But his wife was a sensible bird, and she knew that cobra’s eggs meant young cobras later on. So she flew off from the nest, and left Darzee to keep the babies warm, and continue his song about the death of Nag. </p><p>She fluttered in front of Nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out, “Oh, my wing is broken! The boy in the house threw a stone at me and broke it.” Then she fluttered more desperately than ever.</p></div> </div>
