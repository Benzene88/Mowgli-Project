        <em> We haven’t a camelty tune of our own To help us trollop along, But every neck is a hair trombone (Rtt-ta-ta-ta! is a hair trombone!) And this our marching-song: Can’t! Don’t! Shan’t! Won’t! Pass it along the line! Somebody’s pack has slid from his back, Wish it were only mine! Somebody’s load has tipped off in the road— Cheer for a halt and a row! Urrr! Yarrh! Grr! Arrh! Somebody’s catching it now! </em>
        <p>ALL THE BEASTS TOGETHER :- </p> <em>Children of the Camp are we, Serving each in his degree; Children of the yoke and goad, Pack and harness, pad and load. </em>
