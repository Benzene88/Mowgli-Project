They had made a beautiful nest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges with fibers, and had filled the hollow with cotton and downy fluff. The nest swayed to and fro, as they sat on the rim and cried.</p><p>“What is the matter?” asked Rikki-tikki.</p><p>“We are very miserable,” said Darzee. “One of our babies fell out of the nest yesterday and Nag ate him.”</p><p>“H’m!” said Rikki-tikki, “that is very sad—but I am a stranger here. Who is Nag?”</p><p>Darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering, for from the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hiss—a horrid cold sound that made Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet. </p></div> </div>
