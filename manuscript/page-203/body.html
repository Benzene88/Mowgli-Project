When he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and sorcery that made the priest look very grave.</p><p>Mowgli went on with his work, but it was nearly twilight before he and the wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body.</p><p>“Now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home!
