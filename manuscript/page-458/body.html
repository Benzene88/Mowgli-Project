<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>war-horse to “Bonnie Dundee”! SCREW-GUN MULES As me and my companions were scrambling up a hill, The path was lost in rolling stones, but we went forward still; For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere, Oh, it’s our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to spare! Good luck to every sergeant, then, that lets us pick our road; Bad luck to all the driver-men that cannot pack a load: For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere, Oh, it’s our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to spare! COMMISSARIAT CAMELS We haven’t a camelty tune of our own To help us trollop along, But every neck is a hair trombone (Rtt-ta-ta-ta! is a hair trombone!) And this our marching-song: Can’t! Don’t! Shan’t! Won’t! Pass it along the line! Somebody’s pack has slid from his back, Wish it were only mine! Somebody’s load has tipped off in the road— Cheer for a halt and a row! Urrr! Yarrh! Grr! Arrh! Somebody’s catching it now! ALL THE BEASTS TOGETHER Children of the Camp are we, Serving each in his degree; Children of the yoke and goad, Pack and harness, pad and load. </p><p></p></div> </div>
