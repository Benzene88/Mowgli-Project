Where have you been?”</p><p>It was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything during the four months he stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally bad. Matkah knew better than to answer back. She looked round and cooed: “How thoughtful of you. You’ve taken the old place again.”</p><p>“I should think I had,” said Sea Catch. “Look at me!”</p><p>He was scratched and bleeding in twenty places; one eye was almost out, and his sides were torn to ribbons.</p></div> </div>
