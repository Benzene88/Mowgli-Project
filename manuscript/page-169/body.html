I am tired to-night,—very tired with new things, Gray Brother,—but bring me the news always.”</p><p>“Thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf? Men will not make thee forget?” said Gray Brother anxiously.</p><p>“Never. I will always remember that I love thee and all in our cave. But also I will always remember that I have been cast out of the Pack.”</p><p>“And that thou mayest be cast out of another pack. Men are only men, Little Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond. When I come down here again, I will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge of the grazing-ground.”</p></div> </div>
