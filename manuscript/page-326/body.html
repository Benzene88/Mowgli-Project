If you move I strike, and if you do not move I strike. Oh, foolish people, who killed my Nag!”</p><p>Teddy’s eyes were fixed on his father, and all his father could do was to whisper, “Sit still, Teddy. You mustn’t move. Teddy, keep still.”</p><p>Then Rikki-tikki came up and cried, “Turn round, Nagaina. Turn and fight!”</p><p>“All in good time,” said she, without moving her eyes. “I will settle my account with you presently. Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki. They are still and white. They are afraid. They dare not move, and if you come a step nearer I strike.”</p></div> </div>
