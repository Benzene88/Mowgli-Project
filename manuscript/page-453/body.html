        <p> ELEPHANTS OF THE GUN TEAMS :-</p>
        <em>
            We lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules, The wisdom of our foreheads, the cunning of our knees; We bowed our necks to service: they ne’er were loosed again,— Make way there—way for the ten-foot teams Of the Forty-Pounder train!

        <p>GUN BULLOCKS :- </p>
        <em>
            Those heroes in their harnesses avoid a cannon-ball, And what they know of powder upsets them one and all; Then we come into action and tug the guns again— Make way there—way for the twenty yoke Of the Forty-Pounder train!
