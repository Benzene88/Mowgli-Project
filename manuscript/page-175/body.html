The buffaloes generally keep to the pools and muddy places, where they lie wallowing or basking in the warm mud for hours. </p><p> Mowgli drove them on to the edge of the plain where the Waingunga came out of the jungle; then he dropped from Rama’s neck, trotted off to a bamboo clump, and found Gray Brother. “Ah,” said Gray Brother, “I have waited here very many days. </p><p>“It is an order,” said Mowgli. “I am a village herd for a while. What news of Shere Khan?”</p><p>“He has come back to this country, and has waited here a long time for thee. Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce. But he means to kill thee.”</p></div> </div>
