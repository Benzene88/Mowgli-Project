<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us, And black are the waters that sparkled so green. The moon, o’er the combers, looks downward to find us At rest in the hollows that rustle between. Where billow meets billow, then soft be thy pillow, Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease! The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee, Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas! Seal Lullaby. </p><p>All these things happened several years ago at a place called Novastoshnah, or North East Point, on the Island of St.</p></div> </div>
