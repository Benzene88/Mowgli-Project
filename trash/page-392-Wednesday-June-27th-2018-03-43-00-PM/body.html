<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What never man has seen he has seen through the long night, and the favor of the elephant-folk and of the Gods of the Jungles is with him. </p><p> He shall become a great tracker. He shall become greater than I, even I, Machua Appa! He shall follow the new trail, and the stale trail, and the mixed trail, with a clear eye! He shall take no harm in the Keddah when he runs under their bellies to rope the wild tuskers; and if he slips before the feet of the charging bull elephant, the bull elephant shall know who he is and shall not crush him. </p><p> Aihai! my lords in the chains,”—he whirled up the line of pickets—“here is the little one that has seen your dances in your hidden places,—the sight that never man saw! Give him honor, my lords! Salaam karo, my children. </p></div> </div>
